The script 'PythonScrape.py' scrapes hotel data from the popular hotel reservation site: https://www.booking.com/ up to ten pages of booking lists.

The demonstarted example uses Seoul (destination) and 27-28 March 2019 (stay period) as the inputs.

The output prints a dictionary of hotels with their key info: stars, ratings, and (total) price for the stay period.
